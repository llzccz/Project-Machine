### Get inspired

- https://www.tensorflow.org/js/demos
- https://streamlit.io/gallery

- https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-streamlit
- Alternatives to streamlit:
    - https://anvil.works/articles/4-alternatives-streamlit
- https://huggingface.co/

### Implementation

Your machine learning web application can be based on streamlit, flask, next.js, tensorflow.js or any other framework. It should be deployed on the cloud (Tencent/Alibaba/Google/Microsoft Cloud).

You can use chatgpt or gpt4, if you have the API key.

You can use AI APIs from Baidu/Tencent/Alibaba/Amazon/Google etc., for example:
- https://cloud.tencent.com/product/ai-class

Apply for a domain name if necessary, e.g. [http://an-interesting-ml-app.com](http://an-interesting-ml-app.com).

As an alternative, a WeChat miniprogram is OK as well.

Use emojis or fontawesome/bootstrap icons where appropriate (How can we deliver messages without emojis! Impossible mission!).

You code should be open-sourced and hosted on GitHub.
